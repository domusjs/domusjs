## üß† Philosophy

DomusJS is not a full-stack framework ‚Äî it's an *architecture-first backend kit*.

You get the **building blocks** for designing scalable, decoupled, real-world systems:
- Explicit boundaries.
- Modular contexts.
- Bus-driven execution.
- Zero magic.

DomusJS **trusts you as the architect**: it won‚Äôt hide complexity behind decorators or assumptions.

### üÜö DomusJS vs NestJS

| Aspect             | **DomusJS**                                                             | **NestJS**                                                       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Philosophy**     | Minimalistic, architecture-focused toolkit for experts                 | Full-stack backend framework, batteries-included                 |
| **Abstraction**    | Explicit manual wiring, maximum developer control                      | Heavy use of decorators and metadata abstraction                 |
| **Complexity**     | Low baseline complexity, high flexibility                              | Higher baseline complexity with opinionated layers               |
| **Extensibility**  | Plug-and-play modules, easily replaceable or extendable               | Strong ecosystem, but tightly coupled modules                   |
| **Execution**      | Command/Query/Event Buses as first-class citizens                     | Controller-service driven, CQRS optional                         |
| **Use Cases**      | Best for microservices, event-driven architectures, headless backends | Best for full-stack backends, enterprise APIs, rapid scaffolding |

### üß© When to Use DomusJS

Use **DomusJS** if:

- You are an experienced backend engineer or architect.
- You want **explicit control** over the structure and flows of your application.
- You are building **modular microservices**, **job-driven systems**, or **event-driven backends**.
- You need **native observability, tracing, and decoupled buses**.
- You value **clean architecture patterns** over heavy framework conventions.
- You want to avoid framework lock-in and keep full ownership of your tech stack.

Use **NestJS** if:

- You want an **out-of-the-box solution** with rich CLI, tooling, and conventions.
- You‚Äôre working in a **large team** that benefits from standardization.
- You value **batteries-included** features like controllers, interceptors, Swagger, GraphQL.
- You prefer fast scaffolding and rapid delivery over architecture customization.

## ‚ö° Why DomusJS?

DomusJS exists for developers who:
- Want to push the limits of scalable backend architecture.
- Prefer modular systems over monolithic frameworks.
- Need explicit control over buses, events, jobs, and tracing.
- Believe architecture should be shaped by the problem, not the framework.
